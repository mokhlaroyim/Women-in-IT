                                <p>Girls Leadership teaches the skills to be brave, resilient and connected, equipping girls to make change in their world.
                                    A society where girls and women engage authentically and assertively at every level of decision making in all areas of their lives.
<br/><br/>
<strong>WHAT MAKES US UNIQUE?</strong>
<br/>
1) Girls Leadership works not only with girls, but also with their primary influencers – parents, teachers, and caregivers – to create sustainable impact. Studies show parents and teachers to be the most powerful teachers for girls all the way through high school.
<br/>
2) We put social and emotional learning (SEL) at the foundation of all our leadership development.
<br/>
3) We see girls’ real-life, every-day relationships with friends and family as the primary opportunity we have to teach girls the leadership skills that will serve them over a life-time: self-advocacy, negotiation, compromise, personal responsibility and conflict as an opportunity for change.</p>
