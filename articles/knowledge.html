                                    Girls’ education is about so much more than knowledge. By ensuring that a girl has equal access to education, employment and adequate health care, the benefits will be passed on to her children (both boys and girls), community and her country.
Many of us take our education for granted. We do not appreciate what it affords us. But imagine if you weren’t lucky enough to receive an education. Where would you be? Receiving an education empowers girls to take control of their lives, their families, and their future.

Girls with dreams become women with vision – let’s create a world where this vision runs wild and free.

In the face of these injustices it is easy to feel overwhelmed and powerless. But there are little things we can do each and every day to instigate change. Why not sponsor a girl, or make a donation to a child-focused organisation such as Plan, World Vision, ChildFund or Unicef? Become an Ambassador for an organisation that fights for the girls of our world. Host an event to raise funds and awareness for a specific girls issue you feel particularly passionate about. The best place to begin? Start the conversation. Inform yourself on the issues and be aware of the good and bad progress being made around the world. Visit a developing country and interact with the local communities, and most of all, simply talk about it to others. This is a conversation that needs to be had, and that’s something that each and every one of us can be a part of.
